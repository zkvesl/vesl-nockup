::  +ai-pow-verify: consensus verifier for a version-%4 (%ai-pow) block's
::  recursive certificate. Branch (b): the Hoon body is a fail-safe `!!`; the
::  real implementation is the mandatory `~/ %ai-pow-verify` jet (crate
::  `ai-pow-jets`), which canonicalizes the block commitment (`BLAKE3(jam(..))`,
::  matching the miner), re-derives the canonical matrices from the protocol
::  seed, verifies the compact recursive certificate against the boot-injected
::  setup, and binds it to `[commit target]` (target = merge:bignum LE atom).
::  Lives in this shared lib (imported by both apps/dumbnet/inner.hoon as `mine`
::  and .../lib/consensus.hoon) under a `~% .. ..ut ~` root so the jet's hint
::  chain resolves — the kernel's `%dumb-inner` door can host no extra arm (its
::  `fort` mold fixes it to load/peek/poke) and its `|^`-nested arms fail cold
::  registration. `!!` is fail-safe: a missing/mis-chained jet crashes rather
::  than silently accepting. Called from +check-pow's `%ai-pow` branch.
