::  lib/domain-patterns.hoon: helpers for recurring domain Hoon shapes
::
::  Library-shaped (no manifest, no graft-inject involvement). Import
::  with `/+  *domain-patterns` from your `app.hoon`. Helpers operate
::  inside the kernel; no Rust seam.
::
::  v0.1 ships:
::    ++  apply-<graft>   one per shipped data/behavior graft. Threads
::                        state by the convention that <graft>-graft
::                        state lives at the field named <graft> on
::                        versioned-state.
::    ++  audit-write     bundles delegate-to-storage + log-append.
::
::  Convention: each apply-<graft> arm assumes the graft's state lives
::  at the field named <graft> on the kernel's versioned-state. This
::  matches the usage example in every shipped graft's header — see
::  e.g. counter-graft.hoon:18, log-graft.hoon:36.
::
::  Wet-gate (|*) polymorphism is required because versioned-state is
::  defined by the kernel, not by this library. Type-checking is
::  deferred to the call site. Convention violations surface as
::  `find . <graft>` errors at the call site, not internal hoonc
::  traces. Acceptable failure mode.
::
::  Out of scope: kernel-composite grafts (settle, mint, guard, forge,
::  intent). settle-poke takes a 3rd verify-gate arg; forge-poke is
::  stateless. The other three mechanically fit the 2-arg shape but are
::  kernel composites, not modular state shards. See commit-1 audit
::  notes in the git log for the full rationale.
::
::  Namespace: helpers emit %domain-patterns-* effect tags on internal
::  errors (none in v0.1). Avoid declaring effect tags with that prefix
::  in your domain-effect to prevent collisions.
::
::  See vesl-nockup/.dev/03G_DOMAIN_PATTERN_HELPERS.md for design notes.

::  +audit-write: write to a storage graft, then append a log entry.
::
::  Bundles the "delegate-to-storage + log-append" pattern that R3 B,
::  R7 H, and R9 J hand-coded into ~3-4 lines per arm. Static dispatch
::  on -.target picks the storage graft (kv / registry / queue);
::  unknown heads crash at hoonc-time with a clear trace.
::
::  log-tag and log-body are separate so callers can write one shape
::  and log a different one (R3 B's %revoke-license writes a key
::  delete but logs the human-readable name). Pass log-body=jam-of-write
::  if the same.
::
::  Returns [welded-effects new-state] suitable for =^ binding. Effect
::  order: storage first, then log. Caller welds in their own
::  domain-effect after if applicable.
