::  lib/forge-graft.hoon: stateless STARK proving for single-leaf commits
::
::  The Graft is a library, not a kernel. It provides:
::    1. A poke dispatcher for %forge-prove
::    2. No state, no peek — forge is one-shot. Each %forge-prove
::       hashes the data, generates a STARK proof over the hashing
::       computation, and emits the proof as an effect. Nothing
::       persists.
::
::  Forge is the heaviest commitment tier:
::    mint-graft  — commit a root under a hull-id. No verify.
::    guard-graft — commit + leaf-hash verification. No proof.
::    vesl-graft  — full verify-gate lifecycle with replay protection.
::    forge-graft — same leaf-hash as guard, plus a STARK proof over
::                  the hashing. Pair with a stateful graft (usually
::                  vesl-graft) for registration-check semantics;
::                  forge itself trusts the caller's hull/note-id.
::
::  The proof is bound to `hull` and `root = hash-leaf(data)` via the
::  Fiat-Shamir transcript inside prove-computation. Modifying either
::  after proof generation invalidates all FRI challenges.
::
::  Usage:
::    /+  *forge-graft
::    ...your kernel...
::    ?+  -.cause  [~ state]
::      %forge-prove  [(forge-poke cause) state]

::  No state — forge is pure (modulo the randomness the prover
::  mixes in). Returns an effects list; callers keep their own state
::  untouched when threading the result.
