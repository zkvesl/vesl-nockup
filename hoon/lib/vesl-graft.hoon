::  lib/vesl-graft.hoon: gate-agnostic composable verification for any NockApp
::
::  The Graft is a library, not a kernel. It provides:
::    1. A state fragment (vesl-state) you graft onto your kernel state
::    2. A poke dispatcher for %vesl-register/%vesl-settle/%vesl-verify
::    3. A peek helper for querying registered/settled status
::
::  The caller passes a verify-gate — a function that takes opaque data
::  and an expected root, returns a loobean. RAG is one implementation.
::  Any computation type works. No domain-specific imports.
::
::  Registration is one-shot per hull (AUDIT 2026-04-17 M-01). Once a
::  hull-id is registered with a root, that mapping is immutable for
::  the lifetime of the graft state — roots are treated as permanent
::  commitments. Legitimate key rotation currently requires a fresh
::  deployment. A signature-gated `%vesl-revoke` / `%vesl-rotate` cause
::  is tracked as future work in .dev/FUTURE_WORK.md.
::
::  Usage:
::    /+  *vesl-graft
::    /+  *rag-logic    :: for RAG gate (or your own domain logic)
::    ...your kernel...
::    +$  my-state  [vesl=vesl-state ...your-fields...]

::    =/  my-gate=verify-gate
::      |=  [data=* expected-root=@]
::      (verify-manifest ;;(manifest data) expected-root)
::    ?+  -.cause  [~ state]
::      %vesl-register  (vesl-poke vesl.state cause my-gate)
::      %vesl-settle    (vesl-poke vesl.state cause my-gate)
::      %vesl-verify    (vesl-poke vesl.state cause my-gate)

::  AUDIT 2026-04-17 H-01: settled set rotates per epoch.
::    epoch          — current epoch number (starts 0, bumped on rotate)
::    registered     — hull-id -> merkle-root (persists across epochs)
::    settled        — current-epoch settled note-ids (replay protection)
::    settle-count   — notes settled in the current epoch
::    prior-settled  — previous epoch's settled set (kept for replay lookback)
::  Replay check walks both `settled` and `prior-settled`, giving a
::  ~2x `epoch-cap` lookback window. When `settle-count` hits
::  `epoch-cap` (below), the next settle rotates: prior-settled :=
::  settled, settled := {new-id}, settle-count := 1, epoch += 1.

::  +new-state: fresh empty graft state. Use this in your kernel's load arm

::  AUDIT 2026-04-17 H-02: without a cap, any caller who can poke
::  %vesl-register cheaply can grow state without bound. 10M is the
::  static cap here — large enough that no legitimate deployment
::  hits it, small enough that a spammer can't brick kernel memory.
::  Future work: signed-envelope registration that requires a
::  capability token, so the cap can be lifted for high-throughput
::  graft operators. Tracked in .dev/FUTURE_WORK.md.

::
::  +$verify-gate: domain verification gate signature
::
::  Takes note-id + opaque data + expected root, returns loobean.

::  and performs domain-specific verification.
::
::  AUDIT 2026-04-17 H-03: note-id is now passed to the gate so
::  domain verifiers can enforce `note-id == deterministic-fn(data)`,
::  closing the pre-commit race where an attacker could predict a
::  victim's note-id and settle a different manifest under it first.
::  The graft layer does NOT enforce the binding itself — each
::  domain gate decides what "note-id bound to data" means for it.
::  Gates that don't care can simply ignore the note-id argument.
